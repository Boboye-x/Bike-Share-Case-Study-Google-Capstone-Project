# Bike-Share-Case-Study-Google-Capstone-Project
Introduction
This case study is a Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The data for this case study has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. The dataset is composed of first party data collected by Lyft Bike's and Scooters, LLC ("Bikeshare") and the City of Chicago's ("Divvy") bike sharing service.

For the purposes of this project, the data is recognized to be collected by Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company situated in Chicago. The Dataset consists of bike trips for 12 months from November 2021 - October 2022 dataset

Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations
